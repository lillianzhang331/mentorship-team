# Node.js Mentorship Program

Open Source Software (OSS) is part of the #SalesforceOhana. OSS is crucial to our business, so we are committed to harnessing our culture of innovation to improve the state of the OSS ecosystem. We are not only consumers, but leaders and maintainers of OSS software allowing us to influence those projects to ensure they align with the direction we need to take to be a successful business. This will help us on our journey from a walled garden to an open platform by cutting down on proprietary projects where open standards make sense.
As a recent new grad, I believe this program will be beneficial to my learning and exposure to the Node ecosystem.
